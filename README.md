HackOrNot is an app intended to let audience members participate in a stand-up
comedy show. While this is normally highly, highly discouraged, and comedy clubs
can and should remove people for being on their phones during shows, it's fun at
some alternative shows to play around with the dynamic between comic and crowd.

This was mostly written on the day before such a show, Talkies, so the code is
not especially elegant, especially when it comes to storing and retrieving data.

Improvements to come (some planned, some potential):
- visual tweaks as it's very boring to look at and it wouldn't take much to make it feel more interactive
- improvements in data storage
- better real-time interaction between client and server
- interfaces for creating custom voting categories
- admin interface for creating and editing Events and VoteCategories
- exploring React, Vue, or other component-based front end framework
- better visual representation of results
- so much more?
